    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g unsalted butter, cold from the fridge is fine</li>
        <li>100g light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>60g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract</li>
        <li>150g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3g (1 tsp) salt</li>
        <li>220g dark chocolate, chopped, plus about 150g additional for the tops of the cookies (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°f / 180°c. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place the butter in a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat. Cook until the butter has melted, and then
            continue to cook, swirling the pan often and stirring with a whisk, until the butter foams and turns golden
            brown and nutty - this should take 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Weigh out 110g of the brown butter into a medium bowl and leave to cool for 15-20 minutes so that it does not
            scramble your eggs.</li>
        <li>Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar to the bowl with the brown butter, and mix to combine.</li>
    </ol>
